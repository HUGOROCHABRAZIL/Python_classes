# HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON

The easiest way to install the last version of Python into your computer dependencies is by the Anaconda
distribution from Continuum Analytics. To do so:

1) Access the link to anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution , choose the proper PYTHON 2.X installer
for your operational system and follow the instruction. The Anaconda installer gives almost all the packages
you'll need for building up your primary codes.

2) To check if the installation was successfull, open a command prompt on your Windows PC or a terminal on
Linux or MacOS. Then write down the command: *conda list* which will show the list of installed packages
during the chosen PYTHON 2.X installation.
